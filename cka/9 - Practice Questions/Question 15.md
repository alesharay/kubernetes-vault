SIMULATION -

```bash
[student$node-1] $ kubectl config use-context wk8s
```

Task -

A Kubernetes worker node, named k3d-wk8s-agent-0 is in state NotReady.

Investigate why this is the case, and perform any appropriate steps to bring the node to a Ready state, ensuring that any changes are made permanent.

You can ssh to the failed node using:

```bash
[student@node-1] $ docker exec -it wk8s-agent-0 shnt-0
```

You can assume elevated privileges on the node with the following command:

```bash
[student@k3ds-wk8s-agent-0] $ sudo -i
```
