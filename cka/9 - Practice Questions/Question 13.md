Question 13

SIMULATION -

```bash
[student$node-1] $ kubectl config use-context k8s
```

Context -

An existing Pod needs to be integrated into the Kubernetes built-in logging architecture (e.g. kubectl logs). Adding a streaming sidecar container is a good and common way to accomplish this requirement.

Task -

Add a sidecar container named `sidecar`, using the `busybox` image, to the existing Pod `big-corp-app`. The new sidecar container has to run the following command:

```bash
/bin/sh -c "tail -n+1 -f /var/log/big-corp-app.log"
```

Use a Volume, mounted at `/var/log`, to make the log file `big-corp-app.log` available to the sidecar container.

Don't modify the specification of the existing container other than adding the required volume mount.
