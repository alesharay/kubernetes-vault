- <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">DNS</span></i></b> comes in when you want to access a <i><span style="color:#477bbe">server</span></i> by name rather than <span style="color:#5c7e3e">IP address</span>

- To give an <span style="color:#5c7e3e">IP address</span> a name, you would add an entry to the <span style="color:red">/etc/hosts</span> file
	- Giving the <span style="color:#5c7e3e">IP address</span> in the first column and the name in second

![[dns-1.png]]

- Whatever is put into the <span style="color:red">/etc/hosts</span> file becomes the source of truth
	- This means that there is no check to confirm that the <span style="color:#5c7e3e">IP address</span> and name combination in the <i><span style="color:#477bbe">hosts</span></i> file is actually valid

- Running the <span style="color:red">hostname</span> command gives the name of the <i><span style="color:#477bbe">server</span></i>, this is not necessarily the same name given in the <span style="color:red">/etc/hosts</span> file

![[dns-2.png]]

- The <span style="color:red">/etc/hosts</span> file doesn't just <i><span style="color:#477bbe">host local server</span></i> names, it can also <i><span style="color:#477bbe">host</span></i> web address urls

![[dns-3.png]]

- You can have as many names as you want for as many <i><span style="color:#477bbe">servers</span></i> as you want in the <span style="color:red">/etc/hosts</span> file

- Every time a <i><span style="color:#477bbe">server</span></i> is referred to by name, the <span style="color:red">/etc/hosts</span> file is contacted for the <span style="color:#5c7e3e">IP address</span>

![[dns-4.png]]

- Translating <span style="color:#5c7e3e">hostnames</span> to <span style="color:#5c7e3e">IP addresses</span> using something like the <span style="color:red">/etc/hosts</span> file is known as <span style="color:#5c7e3e">name resolution</span>

- Within a small network, you can get away with the entries in the <span style="color:red">/etc/hosts</span> file but managing these becomes more difficult when the count grows

![[dns-5.png]]

- For a larger count of <i><span style="color:#477bbe">server</span></i> and <span style="color:#5c7e3e">IP address</span> combinations, instead of using the <span style="color:red">/etc/hosts</span> file, we would move all of the entries into a single <i><span style="color:#477bbe">server</span></i> that would manage them centrally; this is called the <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">DNS server</span></i></b> (<b><i><span style="color:#d46644">nameserver</span></i></b>)

- When there is a <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">DNS server</span></i></b> created, you point all <i><span style="color:#477bbe">hosts</span></i> to look at that <i><span style="color:#477bbe">server</span></i> instead of its own <span style="color:red">/etc/hosts</span> file

- To point a <i><span style="color:#477bbe">host server</span></i> to a <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">nameserver</span></i></b> you would use the <span style="color:red">/etc/resolv.conf</span> file
	- (this is called the <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">DNS resolution</span></i></b> configuration file which every <i><span style="color:#477bbe">server</span></i> has)

- To point a <i><span style="color:#477bbe">host server</span></i> to a <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">nameserver</span></i></b>, add an entry to the <span style="color:red">/etc/resolv.conf</span> file
	- Where <span style="color:red">nameserver</span> is in the first column (indicating that we're using a <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">DNS server</span></i></b>) and the <span style="color:#5c7e3e">IP address</span> to the <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">nameserver</span></i></b> in the second

![[dns-6.png]]

- Once the <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">nameserver</span></i></b> is configured on all <i><span style="color:#477bbe">hosts</span></i>, once a host comes across a <span style="color:#5c7e3e">hostname</span> that it doesn't know, it looks it up from the <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">nameserver</span></i></b>

- With the <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">nameserver</span></i></b> configuration, if the <span style="color:#5c7e3e">IP address</span> of any of the <i><span style="color:#477bbe">servers</span></i> were to change, just change it in the <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">nameserver</span></i></b> and all <i><span style="color:#477bbe">hosts</span></i> will resolve to the new name
	- You would no longer need any entries in the <span style="color:red">/etc/hosts</span> file in any of the <i><span style="color:#477bbe">hosts</span></i>

- If there is a <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">nameserver</span></i></b> setup, you can still have entries in the local <span style="color:red">/etc/hosts</span> file
	- This just means that only your <i><span style="color:#477bbe">server</span></i> will be able to access the other <i><span style="color:#477bbe">server</span></i> by name

- If there is an entry in both the <span style="color:red">/etc/hosts</span> file and on the <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">nameserver</span></i></b> for the same host (with different <span style="color:#5c7e3e">IP addresses</span>), the <span style="color:red">/etc/hosts</span> file will take priority over the <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">nameserver</span></i></b>

- By default, the order of where <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">DNS resolutions</span></i></b> are pulled is the /etc/hosts file, then the <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">nameserver</span></i></b>, but that order can be changed by editing the <span style="color:red">/etc/nsswitch.conf</span> file

- To change the order of <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">DNS resolutions</span></i></b>, change the "<span style="color:red">hosts</span>" line in the <span style="color:red">/etc/nsswitch.conf</span> file from "files dns" to "dns files"

![[dns-7.png]]

- If you try to access (<span style="color:#5c7e3e">ping</span>) a <i><span style="color:#477bbe">server</span></i> that is in neither the <span style="color:red">/etc/hosts</span> file or the <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">nameserver</span></i></b> specified, you will not be able to

![[dns-8.png]]

- To access common DNS names like [www.facebook.com](http://www.facebook.com) or [www.google.com](http://www.google.com), you can add a well known <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">nameserver</span></i></b> to your <span style="color:red">/etc/resolv.conf</span> file; 8.8.8.8

![[dns-9.png]]

- The 8.8.8.8 <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">nameserver</span></i></b> is available on the internet and is hosted by and knows about all websites on the internet

- You can have multiple <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">nameservers</span></i></b> configured on your host, but you will then have to configure that on all the <i><span style="color:#477bbe">hosts</span></i> on your network

- You can configure a <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">DNS server</span></i></b> to forward any unknown <span style="color:#5c7e3e">hostnames</span> to the public <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">nameserver</span></i></b> on the internet

![[dns-10.png]]

- A name with a www. at the beginning and a .com at the end is called a domain name and it is how IPs translate to names that we can remember on the public internet

- The reason domain names are separated by dots is to group like things together

- The last portion of the domain name (e.g. .com, .net, .edu, .org, etc…) are the top-level domains that represent the intent of the website
	- .com = commercial (general purpose)
	- .net = network
	- .edu = educational organizations
	- .org = non-profit organizations
	- etc…

![[dns-11.png]]

- Looking at the example [www.google.com](http://www.google.com), the dot is the root, that's where everything starts.

- Looking at the example [www.google.com](http://www.google.com), .com is a top-level domain.

- Looking at the example [www.google.com](http://www.google.com), google is the domain name assigned to Google.

- Looking at the example [www.google.com](http://www.google.com), www. Is a subdomain

- Subdomains help in further grouping things together
	- e.g. Google's map service is available under maps.google.com; thus maps is a subdomain
	- e.g. Google's storage service is available under drive.google.com; thus drive is a subdomain

![[dns-12.png]]

- When you try to reach any of the domains names (say mail.google.com) from within the organization, the request first hits the organizations internal <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">DNS server</span></i></b>.
	- It doesn't know who mail or Google is so it forwards your request to the internet

- On the internet, the <span style="color:#5c7e3e">IP address</span> of the <i><span style="color:#477bbe">server</span></i> serving mail.google.com may be resolved with the help of multiple <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">DNS servers</span></i></b>

- A root <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">DNS server</span></i></b> looks at your request and points you to a <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">DNS server</span></i></b> serving roots

- A top-level domain looks at your request and forwards you to the domain

- The domain's <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">DNS server</span></i></b> provides you the <span style="color:#5c7e3e">IP address</span> of the <i><span style="color:#477bbe">server</span></i> serving the apps applications

- In order to speed up all future results, your organization's <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">DNS server</span></i></b> may choose to cache the <span style="color:#5c7e3e">IP address</span> for a period of time (a few seconds/minutes) that way it doesn't have to go through the entire process again

![[dns-13.png]]

- All subdomains are configured in the domain's internal <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">DNS server</span></i></b>

- The reason we discussed all of the different domain levels is to understand another entry in the <span style="color:red">/etc/resolv.conf</span>file
	- Now that we're dealing with full domain names, we can no longer <span style="color:#5c7e3e">ping</span> using only the subdomain

![[dns-14.png]]

- In order to reference only the subdomain and not the full domain name, you add another entry into the <span style="color:red">/etc/resolv.conf</span>file called a "search" and you give it the domain name minus a subdomain
	- This will automatically get appended to any name that you try to <span style="color:#5c7e3e">ping</span>

![[dns-15.png]]
	- 
	- Next time you try to <span style="color:#5c7e3e">ping</span> a subdomain, you will see that the rest of the domain name will be appended

![[dns-16.png]]

- When a <span style="color:red">search</span> is setup in the <span style="color:red">/etc/resolv.conf</span> file, if you <span style="color:#5c7e3e">ping</span> with the full domain name, your host is smart enough not to append it again
	- This means that this file is idempotent

- You can provide multiple <span style="color:red">search</span> domains on the same line
	- This means if you try and <span style="color:#5c7e3e">ping</span> web, it will resolve to <span style="color:#5c7e3e">web.mycompany.com</span> or <span style="color:#5c7e3e">web.prod.mycompany.com</span>

![[dns-17.png]]

- The way a record is stored in the <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">DNS server</span></i></b> is as follows:
	- A Records - <span style="color:#5c7e3e">IPv4 address</span> to <span style="color:#5c7e3e">hostnames</span>,
	- AAAA Records - <span style="color:#5c7e3e">IPv6 address</span> to <span style="color:#5c7e3e">hostnames</span>,
	- CNAME - mapping one name to another name

![[dns-18.png]]

- As <span style="color:#5c7e3e">ping</span> may not always be the right tool to test <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">DNS resolution</span></i></b>, there are other available tools such as <span style="color:#5c7e3e">nslookup</span>

- You can use <span style="color:#5c7e3e">nslookup</span> to query a <span style="color:#5c7e3e">hostname</span> from a <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">DNS server</span></i></b>

![[dns-19.png]]

- <span style="color:#5c7e3e">nslookup</span> does not consider the entries in the local <span style="color:red">/etc/hosts</span> file

- If you add an entry into the local <span style="color:red">/etc/hosts</span> file and if you try to do an <span style="color:#5c7e3e">nslookup</span> for that web application, it is not going to find it
	- The entry for your web application has to be present in your <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">DNS server</span></i></b>

- <span style="color:#5c7e3e">nslookup</span> only queries the <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">DNS server</span></i></b>

- <span style="color:#5c7e3e">dig</span> is a tool to test <b><i><span style="color:#d46644">DNS name resolution</span></i></b>
	- It returns more details than <span style="color:#5c7e3e">nslookup</span> in a similar form
