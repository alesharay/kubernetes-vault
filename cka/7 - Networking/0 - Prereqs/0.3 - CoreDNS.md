- In order to turn a server into a DNS server, there are many solutions available such as CoreDNS

- CoreDNS binaries can be downloaded from their Github releases page or as a Docker image

- Run the executable to start a DNS server, it by default listens on port 53, which is the default port for a DNS server

- In order to specify the IP to hostnames, you have to provide some configurations
	1. Put all of the entries into the DNS server's <span style="color:red">/etc/hosts</span> file
	2. Configure CoreDNS to use that file
	3. CoreDNS loads it's configuration from a file named Corefile

- Here is a simple configuration that instructs CoreDNS to fetch the IP to hostname mappings from the file <span style="color:red">/etc/hosts</span>
	- When the DNS server is run, it now picks the IPs and names from the <span style="color:red">/etc/hosts</span> file on the server
