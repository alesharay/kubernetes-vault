- In a real “live” Kubernetes cluster implemented for production, there could be a possibility of often switching between a large number of namespaces and clusters
	- This can quickly become a confusing and overwhelming task if you had to rely on kubectl alone

- This is where command line tools such as kubectx and kubens come in to picture
	- Reference:  [https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx)

### Kubectx:

- With this tool, you don’t have to make use of lengthy `kubectl config` commands to switch between contexts.
	- This tool is particularly useful to switch context between clusters in a multi-cluster environment
