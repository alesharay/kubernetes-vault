- When you lose the master node in your cluster, as long as the workers are up and containers are alive, you applications are still running and users can access the application until things start to fail

- In a High Availability solution, you would use multiple master nodes in your production environment

- A High Availability configuration is where you have redundancy across every component in the cluster so as to avoid a single point of failure

- REMINDER: The master node manages the controlplane components
