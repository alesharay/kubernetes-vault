- Kubelet can manage nodes independently

- If kubelet has no kube-apiserver or etcd store to communicate with, there are still things that can be done in order to deploy [[7 - Pods|pods]] onto the node

- [[7 - Pods|pod]] definition files can be placed in a directory on the server and kubelet can read those files to create the [[7 - Pods|pods]]

- Kubelet periodically checks the manifest directory for files, reads those files to create [[7 - Pods|pods]], and makes sure they stay alive

- If the application crashes, kubelet attempts to restart it

- If changes are made to any of the files in the manifest directory, kubelet recreates the [[7 - Pods|pods]] for those changes to take effect

- If a file is deleted from the manifest directory, that [[7 - Pods|pod]] is deleted automatically

- These [[7 - Pods|pods]] that are created directly from manifest files, without input from any of the "control plane" components (kube-apiserver, etcd, etcâ€¦) are known as <b><span style="color:#d46644">static pods</span></b>

- Only [[7 - Pods|pods]] can be created this way (directly from files in the manifest directory)

- Since kubelet works at the [[7 - Pods|pod]] level, it can only understand [[7 - Pods|pods]], which is why it is able to create <b><span style="color:#d46644">static pods</span></b>

### The are two ways to configure the manifest directory

- The manifest directory can be any directory on the host, it just needs to be passed into kubelet as an option while running the service

- This option is called <span style="color:red">--pod-manifest-path</span>

![[static-pods-1.png]]

- Another way to configure the directory is, instead of directly passing the option to the kubelet.service file, you could provide the path to another config file using the --config option, and defining the directory path

- Then in the other file, define the path as the staticpodPath property

![[static-pods-2.png]]

- [[0 - Core Concepts Intro|cluster]]s setup by the <b><i><span style="color:#5c7e3e">kubeadm</span></i></b> tool uses this approach.

- To view these files, first ssh into the node where the [[7 - Pods|pods]] were deployed

- Then identify the kubelet config file using the following commands

Linux:

ps -aux | grep -i /usr/bin/kubelet

Mac:

ps -el | grep -i /usr/bin/kubelet

- Jot down the `--config` path

![[static-pods-3.png]]

- Then lookup the value assigned for staticpodPath:

grep -i staticpod KUBELET_CONFIG_FILE_DIR/CONFIG_FILE_NAME

- Since kubectl works by using the kube-apiserver which is not available for <b><span style="color:#d46644">static pods</span></b>, to view the kubelet.service file, you must use the docker ps command

![[static-pods-4.png]]

- If there is a [[0 - Core Concepts Intro|cluster]] with an available kube-apiserver, kubelet can then take in requests for creating [[7 - Pods|pods]] from different inputs

- The [[7 - Pods|pod]] definition files through the <b><span style="color:#d46644">static pods</span></b> directory
- An HTTP API endpoint

- This is how the kube-apiserver sends input to kubelet

- Kubelet can create both kinds of [[7 - Pods|pods]] at the same time

- In the case that kubelet creates both kinds of [[7 - Pods|pods]], the kube-apiserver IS aware of the statically created [[7 - Pods|pods]]

- In this case, if the kubectl command is run on the master node, all [[7 - Pods|pods]] will be listed

- This happens because if kubelet is part of a [[0 - Core Concepts Intro|cluster]] when creating <b><span style="color:#d46644">static pods</span></b>, it also creates a mirror object in the kube-apiserver

- What you see from the kube-apiserver is a read-only mirror of the [[7 - Pods|pod]]

- You can view details about the [[7 - Pods|pods]] but you can't edit or delete them like normal [[7 - Pods|pods]]
- The only way to edit or delete these [[7 - Pods|pods]] is as mentioned above, by modifying or removing them directly from the specified manifest directory

- The name of the <b><span style="color:#d46644">static pod</span></b> is automatically appended with the node name

### Why would you use Static pods

- Since <b><span style="color:#d46644">static pods</span></b> are not dependent on the control plane, you can use <b><span style="color:#d46644">static pods</span></b> to deploy control plane components manually as [[7 - Pods|pods]] on the node

- Start by deploying kubelet on all of the master nodes
- Then create [[7 - Pods|pod]] definition files that use docker images of the various control plane components (kube-apiserver, controller, etcd, scheduler)
- Place these definition files in the specified manifest directory and kubelet will take care of the rest

- This method allows you to avoid downloading the binaries and configuring the services

- Using this method, if any of the [[7 - Pods|pods]] were to crash, the <b><span style="color:#d46644">static pods</span></b> will automatically be restarted by kubelet

- This is actually how <b><i><span style="color:#5c7e3e">kubeadm</span></i></b> sets up a <span style="color:#5c7e3e">Kubernetes</span> [[0 - Core Concepts Intro|cluster]]

#### Practice Problems

- How many <b><span style="color:#d46644">static pods</span></b> exist in this [[0 - Core Concepts Intro|cluster]] in all namespaces?

		kubectl get pods --all-namespaces

(view the [[7 - Pods|pods]] with a node name at the end)

- What is the path of the directory holding the <b><span style="color:#d46644">static pod</span></b> definition files?

		ssh NODE_NAME
		ps -aux | grep -i /usr/bin/kubelet
		(view either the --config or <span style="color:red">--pod-manifest-path</span>)
		grep -i staticpod PATH_NAME

- Create a <b><span style="color:#d46644">static pod</span></b> named "static-busybox" that uses the "busybox" image and the command sleep 1000

		kubectl run static-busybox --restart=Never --image=busybox --dry-run=client -o yaml --command -- sleep 1000 > PATH_NAME/static-busybox-pod.yaml

(--command must be last I think)

- Edit the image on the <b><span style="color:#d46644">static pod</span></b> to use "busybox:1.28.4"

		vi PATH_NAME/static-busybox-pod.yaml
		image: busybox:1.28.4

- Delete the busybox <b><span style="color:#d46644">static pod</span></b>

		rm -f PATH_NAME/static-busybox-pod.yaml
